In 2013, the company decided to shut down its hardware manufacturing business because it offers no competitive advantage. It would
no longer build Wipro–branded desktops, laptops, and servers, including the SuperGenuis line of PCs and NetPower servers. It would
now look to beef up its footprint as a systems integrator and increase its focus on IT services.
